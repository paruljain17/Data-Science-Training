best fit is the line which cover most of the data points 
linear regression is the relationship between x and y
simple linear regression has one x and one y
multiple linear  regression is y=m1x1+m2x2+m3x3+e(error)
Bestfit line --> M & C -->optimal values (MSE,MAE)
MAE = Deal with outliners
MSE= not deak with outliners
Cost Function ->loss calculate 
Variation is how much the actual data is differ with average 
Feature selection 
Adjusted R
data -> IV -> columns ->correlation
R ->accuracy ko bdha dega kuki uska kisi column pr frk nhi pd rha isliye ye case glt hai that why adjusted r 
model training ---- training(80),testing(20)   jitna  negative me data hoga usko utna ignore krenge mtlb nhi lenge
